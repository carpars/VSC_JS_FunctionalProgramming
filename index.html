                                        Recursion is a function that calls itself, from within. Because of that, the

                                                        clear and
                                                        emphatized.
                                                        This will be very useful for us, when starting with the actual

                                                We saw in the last point the way in which a While loop iterates. From
                                                this:
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Let's think in the while loop. And let's think about ways we can iterate
                                                without
                                                looping.
                                                The way to think about this is trying to <h5>reproduce the effect of a

                                                Currying is the way of consolidate the code of multiple functions that
                                                may share
                                                the
                                                same code but
                                                may take different args each one of their versions generated. GOOD FOR
                                                MAINTAINABILITY, NOT HAVING TO CHANGE SEVERAL REPEATED CODE EACH TIME.

                                                    when you call afunction you have to pass ALL of their arguments. May
                                                    be the same every time you call it, as for example in this code:
                                                </p>
                                                <img class="img-code" src="assets/img/11.PNG">
                                                <p>
                                                    We can factor out the "Hello" part from the function. Though this
                                                    supposes some flexibility missing: the function just can say
                                                    "Hello".
                                                </p>

                                                    But VERSATILITY is what we pursuit when using functions. Then, we
                                                    can create another functions:
                                                </p>

                                            </li>

                                                <p>
                                                    This means many more funcitons to maintain. And, what if we want to
                                                    add some testing to our code? We need to repeat it in every single
                                                    function. A lot of extra-code and redundancy in our code. See:

                                            We can also usea PURE function: pass a function as argument
                                            where we return the operation with each item. The
                                            getLength() function here is a pure function:

                                            IN FACT, A GOOD MAPING FUNCTION IS A PURE FUCNTION:

                                            <li>
                                                it takes a single value of the type in the array being
                                                mapped.
                                            </li>

                                                It operates on that value without creating side-effects.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                it Always produces the same result from the same input
                                                value.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                it returns a value of the expected type in the new array
                                                -because every element is the type the function returns.

                                                modification in other contexts.

                                            <strong>Optionally the anonymous function sets the initial value of
                                                the accumulator</strong>, thanks to the JS feature of type
                                            conversion and operator overload in JS. It's optional unless you
                                            need to control the type or the value at the beginning of your
                                            operation in order to ensure you get the result you where expecting.

                                            IN MOST CASES, IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO SET IT. See:

                                            The reason why the value got is "cat34" is the way JS overloads the addition
                                            operator: accepts string and numbers, but if one of the value is a string,
                                            the addition operator is going to treat the result as it is going to be a
                                            string.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            And in this case, as we didn't set an accumulator initial value, the
                                            operator assumes the fiors value is going to be the fist one set for the
                                            sum, and since the first value is 'cat' it assumes that the '+' operator
                                            should be used to add together string values and to return a string.

                                            The reduce function can be tricky to read.
                                            <strong>For that reason our trick is putting out the PURE anonymous function

                                                functionality yusing small pieces of existing functionallity.

                                                In order to do that, you are going to want to nest your functions, which
                                                is something JS allows you to do. In fact, it has been hitten in some
                                                examples you have already seen.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                we know JS allow us to use functions that call to functions. High-order
                                                functions can take a function as an argument, or return a function.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Function methods can also be changed. You can take a serie of pure
                                                functions that return a value, and each of them can perform its function
                                                independently, and passes a return value to the next one. So the
                                                sequence of functions can be called all in a single line.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>But in addition, JS allows you to pass functions to other functions
                                                    <strong>using nested parenthesis</strong>, and when a function
                                                    followed by parenthesis is being passed to another function, it's
                                                    not passed as the funciton, but rather value of performing that
                                                    function:
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    <img class="img-code" src="assets/img/20.PNG">
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    To notice about is the order of operations: timesTwo(3) returns 6,
                                                    and then adds 1, and produces 7. When you are reading a function
                                                    that is nested inside of another function, you should read the
                                                    function called in the inner parentheses as if it where just the
                                                    return value, of what you would get if you run that function
                                                    independently.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Even in the simplest extreme, the order of the nesting matters:
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    <img class="img-code" src="assets/img/21.PNG">

                                                <p>
                                                    Having switched the order, the result is different. <strong> ORDER
                                                        MATTERS, is the most important point in Composition.</strong>

                                                    NESTING HAVE NO LIMITS IN JS. What we have done here is essentially
                                                    compose new functionality within JS by nesting existing functions.
                                                    We can go as fas as we want, following a set of RULES FOR

                                            It is nesting versions of existing functions, for defining new functions.

                                        <p>
                                            So you can define a new function, that behaves like a set of nested
                                            functions, using smaller pure functions as components.

                                            This way, we have made composition avoiding a lot of extra parenthesis. But,
                                            <strong> have created a state variable, and we don'0 want that in Funcitonal
                                                programming</strong>. Lets fugire out if we can eliminate that
                                            intermediate variable: let's use nesting instead:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The solution is <strong> Compose function (not currently native to
                                                JS)</strong>(not currently native to JS) that would take two functions
                                            and nest them, producing a new function.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This new function will be the result of applying the compose() function and
                                            then passing in the first function and the second function:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            compose(firstFunction,secondFunction);
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The tricky part is the order in which the operations will be perform, which
                                            in nested functions is a very critical aspect.
                                        </p>

                                            We need to take two fnctions as arguments, and return a composed function
                                            that nests them, which is able to take a value that can pass in.

                                        <p>

                                            We admit some decisions, we decided the 2nd passed function is the first
                                            that performs an operation in the value. This is the common practice in
                                            Functional programming, ths 2nd passed is the nested, first in operate
                                            [SINCE IT IS MORE CRITICAL TO CHANGE -NO ENTENDIDO BIEN, REVISAR].
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Let's test our compose function:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <img class="img-code" src="assets/img/26.PNG">
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Then we see how easy having a compose function makes it to combine those
                                            nested functions and quickly create variations. In fact, we can create a lot
                                            of variations using just one line for each one, without reading a lot of
                                            redundant code:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>

                                            Things to keep in mind when you are composing:

                                                Keep track of the return types

                                            <li>
                                                Don't try to compose impure functions

                                            <li>
                                                Who needs to understand your code

                                                    the ability for variatic functions is an important aspect. Let's
                                                    demonstrate it:
                                                </p>

                                                    the function divide() takes 2 args. Since we are starting with
                                                    divide() , we need to pass two values: 4, 2. But we get NaN

                                            Then, knowing how compose works, it's good to <strong> a Functional
                                                prograaming library</strong> that includes a robust compose method that
                                            you are comfortable working with.

                                        <p>
                                            For example, this is the compose() method of the library Underscore

                                                How other methods behave inside the library.

                                            And ultimately, <span class="bold-text"> once you have understood how Functional programming works, and you know which utility method you want, </span><span class="upper-bold-text">choosing a library is the best path to follow</span>.
